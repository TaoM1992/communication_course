Presentation Instructions
------

The last assignment will be individual presentations. Your presentation will be a 4 minute "Lightning"-style talk. [Lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) are popular in tech, for example all the company pitches were lightning talks. It is also a common format to share / demo your work to gain greater recognition within an organization. These short talks are beneficial for the presenter (a lower stakes method of public speaking) and the audience (convey a lot information very quickly). 

Deliverables
-----

Submit on Canvas:

1. Link to a __public__ TubeYube video of presentation.
2. Link to __public__ slides. If there is code, it should be linked to in the slides. 

Guidelines:
-----

- Your talk must be public on YouTube.
- All presentations artifacts (e.g., slides and/or code) must be public.
    + It is does not matter where your slides are hosted. They just need to be indexable by Google search and rendered natively on the web.
    - Suggested options:
        - Slideshare
        - Google Slides with correct permissions
        - GitHub 
        - Your personal website
- All items must have your full professional name, title of talk, and a short description. These items will be part of your public Data Science portfolio. You can not take them down until you get a job after graduation.
- If you have an issue with this assignment being public, please reach out to me to discuss it.
